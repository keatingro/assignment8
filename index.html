        For my final project I want to make a way more advanced version of my chat bot from assignment 5. My original
        assignment was just a very simplistic chatbot based on the personality of my roommate. For my final project I
        want to make a revamped version with more features and better design. The original design for the website is a
        simple black and green text terminal look, for the final project I want to make a stylized modern website with a
        similar layout but fancier look. As well as I want to make the design of the website change depending on the
        mood of the bot. I also want to make the original picture slightly animated where he smiles/talks after
        producing a response. Before, all the bot did was respond to certain phrases and have randomized responses based
        on phrases my roommate says in real life. For the final project I want to make it more in depth by having him
        repeat phrases the users says and ask the user more in depth questions. Iâ€™m much better at graphic design than
        coding so I will focus more on the layout of the website, but I will still focus on improving the intelligence
        of the chatbot. Linked above is my original chatbot assignment.</p>
